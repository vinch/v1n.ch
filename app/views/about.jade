      p My name is <strong>Vincent Battaglia</strong>. I was born and grew up in Belgium. My father is Italian, which explains my last name, but my mother tongue is French. I currently live in Barcelona with my wife and my daughter, after four years in San Francisco, California.
      p I define myself as a <strong>Product Engineer</strong> although I’m more like a <strong>Jack-of-All-Trades</strong>. I started my career as a Full-Stack Engineer, but moved slowly away from Engineering, into a Product Management role. I studied computer science at the university and I have a significant experience in Front-End technologies (especially JavaScript), but I’m also very interested in UX and UI design. I love being involved in all stages of a project, and deliver wonderful products using modern techniques like <strong>Lean Startup</strong> and <strong>Agile</strong> (Scrum/Kanban).
      p I currently work on amazing projects at <a href='http://www.diogeno.com' target='_blank'>Diogeno</a>. In the past, I worked at <a href='http://www.emakina.com' target='_blank'>Emakina</a>, <a href='http://1md.be' target='_blank'>1MD</a>, <a href='http://www.woorank.com' target='_blank'>WooRank</a> (in Belgium), <a href='http://storify.com' target='_blank'>Storify</a> and <a href='http://instaply.com' target='_blank'>Instaply</a> (in San Francisco).
      p I have many passions, including gastronomy, nutrition, enology, rock music, contemporary art and soccer. I also really enjoy travelling, biking and hiking.
